    details: The NASA Hubble Space Telescope was named after astronomer Edwin Hubble who studied distant galaxies.
  - title: Fact about Hubble Telescope
    details: Hubble's history dates back to the 1940s! In 1946, Lyman Spitzer wrote a paper about the advantages of studying astronomy from space and he presented the idea of a “Large Space Telescope.” The first group began work on this Large Space Telescope in 1974.

    details: Hubble launched aboard space shuttle Discovery on STS-31 from Kennedy Space Center, Florida. It launched on April 24, 1990 and was deployed one day later, April 25.
  - title: Fact about Hubble Telescope
    details: Hubble is a joint international project between NASA and the European Space Agency.
  - title: Fact about Hubble Telescope
    details: Our atmosphere blocks some wavelengths and blurs Earth telescope's images. That is why Hubble is in orbit beyond our atmosphere-- to get a clearer picture than what Earth telescopes can capture.
  - title: Fact about Hubble Telescope
    details: Hubble detects visible, near-infrared and ultraviolet light.
  - title: Fact about Hubble Telescope
    details: Hubble has to be very accurate. It must focus without moving 7/1000th of an arcsecond. That equates to about the width of a human hair seen from 1 mile away!
  - title: Fact about Hubble Telescope
    details: Hubble is one of NASA's four Great Observatories. The other three are/were the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory, the Chandra X-ray Observatory and the Spitzer Space Telescope.
  - title: Fact about Hubble Telescope
    details: Hubble travels at a speed of 17,500 miles/27,300 kilometers per hour as it orbits Earth. It takes approximately 95 minutes to complete one trip around Earth.
  - title: Fact about Hubble Telescope
    details: The sun powers Hubble through solar cells on each winged array. Some of that power is reserved for when Hubble is in Earth's shadow in orbit.
  - title: Fact about Hubble Telescope
    details: There have been five missions to upgrade the Hubble Space Telescope after its launch. The final service mission was during space shuttle Atlantis STS-125.
  - title: Fact about Hubble Telescope
    details: The closest object observed by Hubble is the Moon.
  - title: Fact about Hubble Telescope
    details: The farthest star Hubble has observed is called Icarus and it is about 5 BLLION light-years away. A light-year describes distance for space objects, referring to the distance light travels in one year. One light-year is about 6 trillion miles, or 9 trillion kilometers!

    details: Farthest galaxy Hubble as observed is 13.3 BILLION light-years away - the galaxy MACS0647-JD (below).
  - title: Fact about Hubble Telescope
    details: Thanks to Hubble and the European Space Agency's Gaia space observatory, it has been calculated that the universe is approximately 13.8 BILLION years old.

    details: We have learned that black holes are at the center of almost every major galaxy from observations from Hubble. Learn more about this discovery.
