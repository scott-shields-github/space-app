subject: James Webb Space Telescope
facts:
  - title: What is the James Webb Space Telescope?
    details: The James Webb Space Telescope, also called Webb or JWST, is a large, space-based observatory, optimized for infrared wavelengths, which will complement and extend the discoveries of the Hubble Space Telescope. It will have longer wavelength coverage and greatly improved sensitivity. The longer wavelengths enable Webb to look further back in time to find the first galaxies that formed in the early Universe, and to peer inside dust clouds where stars and planetary systems are forming today.
  - title: What was the Webb called before it was named after James Webb?
    details: The James Webb Space Telescope was originally called the "Next Generation Space Telescope," or NGST. It was called "Next Generation" because Webb will build on and continue the science exploration started by the Hubble Space Telescope. Discoveries by Hubble and other telescopes have caused a revolution in astronomy and have raised new questions that require a new, different, and more powerful telescope. Webb is also a "Next Generation" telescope in an engineering sense, introducing new technologies like the lightweight, deployable primary mirror that will pave the way for future missions. On 10 September 2002, the Next Generation Space Telescope was named in honor of James E. Webb, NASA's second administrator.
  - title: Who was James E. Webb?
    details: This space-based observatory is named after James E. Webb (1906- 1992), NASA's second administrator. Webb is best known for leading Apollo, a series of lunar exploration programs that landed the first humans on the Moon. However, he also initiated a vigorous space science program that was responsible for more than 75 launches during his tenure, including America's first interplanetary explorers.
  - title: How will Webb be better than the Hubble Space Telescope?
    details: Webb is designed to look deeper into space to see the earliest stars and galaxies that formed in the Universe and to look deep into nearby dust clouds to study the formation of stars and planets. In order to do this, Webb will have a much larger primary mirror than Hubble (2.7 times larger in diameter, or about 6 times larger in area), giving it more light-gathering power. It also will have infrared instruments with longer wavelength coverage and greatly improved sensitivity than Hubble. Finally, Webb will operate much farther from Earth, maintaining its extremely cold operating temperature, stable pointing and higher observing efficiency than with the Earth-orbiting Hubble.
  - title: When was Webb launched?
    details: Webb was launched on December 25th, 2021 at 7:20 AM (12:20 UTC).
  - title: How did Webb's launch windows work?
    details: The Webb launch windows refer to the period each day during which Webb could be launched to reach its intended L2 orbit. In space, the Webb Observatory will not reside precisely at the L2 point but will slowly rotate around it twice per year in a loop that is even bigger than the Moon’s orbit around the Earth. The geometry of this rotation varies depending on the launch time of day and the season of the year (due to the tilt of Earth's axis)
  - title: How was Webb launched?
    details: Webb was launched on an Ariane 5 ECA rocket. The launch vehicle is part of the European contribution to the mission.
  - title: Why was the Ariane 5 chosen to launch Webb? Why did NASA not change to Space X?
    details: >-
      We chose Ariane in the early 2000's for a combination of reliability (it was the only launch vehicle that met NASA's requirements for launching a mission like Webb) and for the value it brings via our international partnership.

      By "value" we mean that the European Space Agency provides us a launch vehicle and associated services on a no exchange of funds basis. In exchange, NASA guarantees European scientists a fraction of observing time on Webb (roughly 15%). Since architectural realities of Webb and international technology restrictions (plus industrial capabilities and strategic technology interests) meant we couldn't have a spacecraft bus or a sunshield or telescope parts from Europe, we asked for the launch vehicle, launch services and science instruments instead.

      Another reason not to change launch vehicles midway through a project is because each vehicle has its own environmental characteristics. Rockets are all similar to an extent, but they do have significant differences in their major vibro-acoustic modes. Designing something to encompass any/all environmental specifications is pretty tough, adds cost and mass, and reduces capability. Knowing your launch vehicle early helps you design for it. Also, launch programs (ascent profiles) are specific not only to the vehicle but are even quasi-specific to the day of the year and time of day. This means you need to know not only your launch vehicle but your launch location.

      Agreements with Ariane were made to ensure the use of the Ariane 5 for our launch in 2021.
  - title: Why do we have to go to space at all? Can we not get these data with large telescopes on the ground, using adaptive optics?
    details: The Earth's atmosphere is nearly opaque and glows brightly at most of the infrared wavelengths that Webb will observe, so a cold telescope in space is required. For those wavelengths that are transmitted to the ground, the Earth's atmosphere blurs the images and causes stars to twinkle. Currently, adaptive optics systems can correct for this blurring only over small fields of view near bright stars functioning as reference beacons, allowing access to only a small fraction of the sky. Artificial light beacons created with strong lasers may provide better access to the sky, but the technology to provide a wide field of view is still far in the future. Finding the earliest galaxies will require very low foreground light levels, ultra-sharp images over large areas, and studies at many infrared wavelengths, a combination of observing conditions only available from space.
  - title: How long will the Webb mission last?
    details: After a successful launch of NASA's James Webb Space Telescope Dec. 25, and completion of two mid-course correction maneuvers, the Webb team has analyzed its initial trajectory and determined the observatory should have enough propellant to allow support of science operations in orbit for significantly more than a 10-year science lifetime.  (The minimum baseline for the mission is five years.)
  - title: Why is Webb not serviceable like Hubble?
    details: Hubble is in low-Earth orbit, located approximately 375 miles (600 km) away from the Earth, and is therefore readily accessible for servicing. Webb will be operated at the second Sun-Earth Lagrange point, located approximately 1 million miles (1.5 million km) away from the Earth, and will therefore be beyond the reach of any crewed vehicle currently being planned for the next decade. In the early days of the Webb project, studies were conducted to evaluate the benefits, practicality and cost of servicing Webb either by human space flight, by robotic missions, or by some combination such as retrieval to low-Earth orbit. Those studies concluded that the potential benefits of servicing do not offset the increases in mission complexity, mass and cost that would be required to make Webb serviceable, or to conduct the servicing mission itself.
  - title: Why did we not assemble Webb in orbit?
    details: >-
      Various scenarios were studied, and assembling in orbit was determined to be unfeasible.

      We examined the possibility of in-orbit assembly for Webb. The International Space Station does not have the capability to assemble precision optical structures. Additionally, space debris that resides around the space station could have damaged or contaminated Webb's optics. Webb's deployment happens far above low Earth orbit and the debris that is found there.

      Finally, if the space station were used as a stopping point for the observatory, we would have needed a second rocket to launch it to its final destination at L2. The observatory would have to be designed with much more mass to withstand this “second launch,” leaving less mass for the mirrors and science instruments.
  - title: Will Webb use gyroscopes for pointing?
    details: >-
      Gyroscopes are used in combination with star tracker assemblies (STAs) to estimate the orientation of the observatory. In the Webb attitude control design, this estimate is used to slew the observatory from target to target, and maintain pointing on a target prior to fine guide and science operations. Typically, at least three gyroscopes oriented in three different directions are needed to determine the orientation of the observatory (although innovative operational procedures allowed Hubble to get by with just two working gyros plus other sensors prior to its last servicing mission). Like Hubble and many other spacecraft, Webb begins life with a redundant set of working gyros, so multiple gyro failures may be accommodated without loss of scientific capability, but unlike Hubble, Webb employs a very different kind of gyroscope.

      Hubble uses traditional mechanical gyroscopes, which measure the inertia of a small spinning flywheel to sense angular motion. Mechanical flywheels require moving parts in a fluid medium, and thus are subject to wear over time. Webb uses "Hemispherical Resonator Gyros" or HRGs. Sometimes called "wine glass gyroscopes," HRGs measure the flexing vibration of a bowl-shaped stemmed crystal to sense angular motion. HRGs operate in a vacuum and have no rotating or rubbing parts, so they suffer virtually no wear. Webb houses two HRGs, each internally contains two processors and power supply boards (2 for 1 redundancy) cross strapped to 4 gyros (4 for 3 redundancy). In the current architecture, one HRG is active receiving commands and providing telemetry, while the other HRG is in backup mode.

      Webb's HRGs and the Fine Guidance Sensor (FGS) instrument work with the final optic in the telescope, called the fine steering mirror (FSM), to stabilize the beam of light coming from the telescope and going into the science instruments. The FSM can tip and tilt a minute amount very quickly to compensate for small motions or "jitter" in the light beam, thus avoiding the need to point the whole observatory extremely precisely on a target. The HRG, in concert with the STAs and the reaction wheels, help stabilize roll about the optical axis.
  - title: How is Webb pointed?
    details: >-
      To turn and point at different objects in space, Webb uses six reaction wheels to rotate the observatory. The reaction wheels are basically flywheels, which store angular momentum. The effect of angular momentum is familiar in bicycle riding. It is much easier to stay up on the bike when it is moving than when it is standing still, and the bicycle will tend to go straight in 'no hands' mode thanks to the angular momentum of the spinning wheels. Slowing down or speeding up one or more of the Webb's reaction wheels alters the total angular momentum of the whole observatory and consequently the observatory turns to conserve angular momentum. Hubble uses reaction wheels also to turn to point at different objects.

      The reaction wheels work in combination with three star trackers and six gyroscopes that provide feedback on where the observatory is pointing and how fast it is turning. This enables coarse pointing sufficient to keep the solar array pointed at the Sun and the high-gain antenna pointed at the Earth. To take images and spectra of astronomical targets (i.e., galaxy, star, planet, etc.) finer pointing is needed. Additional information for finer pointing from the Fine Guidance Sensor in Webb's integrated science instrument module (ISIM) is used to move the telescope's fine steering mirror (FSM) to steady the beam of light coming from the telescope and going into the science instruments. Webb's reaction wheels, star trackers, gyroscopes, Fine Guidance Sensor, and fine steering mirror work together in the observatory's attitude control system (ACS) to precisely point and stare at targets so that the science instruments can see them and see them clearly. The system works much the same way your body uses multiple methods of differing precision -your inner ears and eyes and nervous system and muscles - to catch a baseball in the outfield.
  - title: How big is Webb?
    details: >-
      The most important size of a telescope is the diameter of the primary mirror, which is approximately 6.5 meter (21.3 ft) for Webb. This is about 2.75 times larger in diameter than Hubble, or about 6 times larger in area. The Webb has a mass of approximately 6,500 kg, with a weight of 14,300 lbs on Earth (in orbit, everything is weightless), a little more than half the mass of Hubble. The largest structure of Webb will be its sunshade, which must be able to shield the deployed primary mirror and the tower that holds the secondary mirror. The sunshade is approximately the size of a tennis court.
  - title: Why does the sunshield have five layers rather than one thick one?
    details: Each successive layer of the sunshield is cooler than the one below. The heat radiates out from between the layers, and the vacuum between the layers is a very good insulator. One big thick sunshield would conduct the heat from the bottom to the top more than 5 layers separated by vacuum.
  - title: How will Webb communicate with scientists at Earth?
    details: The Webb will send science and engineering data to Earth using a high frequency radio transmitter. Large radio antennas that are part of the NASA Deep Space Network will receive the signals and forward them to the Webb Science and Operation Center at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, Maryland, USA.
